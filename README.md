# Bug-Walk
This project simulates a bug walking randomly throughout a room. A bug is placed in the middle of a tile floor in a rectangular room of size n x m tiles. The bug walks randomly to any adjacent tile. The program will determine the number of steps it takes the bug to touch every tile in the room at least once.
